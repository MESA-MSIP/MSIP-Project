## Introduction

The MESA MSIP Project was a student driven project that assessed the issue with the sign in flow for the MESA program. Students designed the software written in Java, with Java Swing as the front-end, and storing data with a local SQL Database. A student hardware team and mentor built the chassis and structured the wiring of the project. Student software teams implemented the infrastructure and I/O of the final product.
